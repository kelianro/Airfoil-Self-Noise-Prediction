# ✈️ Airfoil Self-Noise Prediction

## 📋 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to predict the **sound pressure level (dB)** generated by an airfoil based on aerodynamic and geometric parameters. This is a critical regression problem for aeroacoustic design in the aerospace industry.

This study uses the **NASA Airfoil Self-Noise Dataset** and compares baseline models with advanced ensemble techniques to achieve high-precision noise prediction.

## 📂 Dataset and Features
The dataset consists of **1,503 instances** from wind tunnel tests conducted by NASA on NACA 0012 airfoils. 

**Input Features:**
1. **Frequency (Hz):** The sound frequency.
2. **Angle of attack (°):** Incidence angle of the airflow.
3. **Chord length (m):** Geometric width of the airfoil.
4. **Free-stream velocity (m/s):** Air speed.
5. **Suction side displacement thickness (m):** Boundary layer thickness.

**Target Variable:**
* **Sound Pressure Level (dB):** The intensity of the aerodynamic noise.

## 🛠️ Methodology
We implemented a progressive machine learning workflow:
1. **Data Exploration:** Correlation analysis and quality check (no missing values).
2. **Pre-processing:** Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`.
3. **Baseline Model:** Simple Linear Regression.
4. **Advanced Model:** Random Forest Regressor with **Grid Search** optimization.
5. **Ensemble Learning:** **Stacking Regressor** combining Linear Regression and Random Forest.

## Final Results
According to our final evaluation, the Stacking Regressor is the most effective model:

| Model | RMSE (Error) | R² Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linear Regression** | 4.70 dB | 0.558 |
| **Stacking Regressor** | **1.77 dB** | **0.937** |

* **Accuracy:** The model explains **93.7%** of the variance in the acoustic data.
* **Precision:** The average prediction error is only **1.77 dB**, which is highly significant for engineering applications.

##  Conclusion
The project successfully provide a reliable machine learning tool that can be integrated into the preliminary design phase. This solution allows engineers to bypass the high cost and time required for initial wind tunnel testing by providing high-accuracy noise predictions.
